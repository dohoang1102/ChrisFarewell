ChrisFarewell
=============
Dear Chris,

Since you are our resident iOS app mogul, we decided that the only way to bid you farewell is with an app, rather than a card.

Run the sucka in XCode and get people to come up and leave messages on your phone. This way our warmest wishes will warm your back pocket. That, or it's the iPhone battery about to explode.

For your enjoyment, some messages from people who cann't make it on friday, have been included with the app.
